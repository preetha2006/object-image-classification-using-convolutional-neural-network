# object-image-classification-using-convolutional-neural-network
A deep learning project that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify real-world objects from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model is trained on 10 object categories and includes data preprocessing, model training, performance evaluation, and visualization of accuracy and loss metrics.
